# Chicago Divvy Bicycle Project

[<span style="color:blue">Divvy</span>](https://www.divvybikes.com/) is a bicycle sharing system in the City of Chicago and two adjacent suburbs operated by Motivate for the Chicago Department of Transportation. It operates 5800 bicycles at 580 stations in an area bounded by 87th Street on the south, Central Street in Evanston on the north, Rainbow Beach Park near South Shore Drive on the east, and Harlem Avenue in Oak Park on the west.

In this blog, I proformed a series of data processing, visualization, and analysis.

------

## 1. Data Description

### Bicycle Data

You can download the Divvy Bicycle data from 2013 to 2017 .
There are two data sets.

1. [data set of historical trip](https://www.divvybikes.com/system-data), which includes:

   * trip start day and time

   * trip end day and time
   * trip start station id
   * trip end station id
   * rider type (Member, Single Ride, and Explore Pass)
   * ...

2. [data set of stations](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Divvy-Bicycle-Stations-Historical/eq45-8inv), which includes:
   * station id
   * timestamp: recorded every 10 minutes
   * docks in service
   * percent full: percentage of docks in service containing an available bike
   * latitude
   * longitude
   * ...

------

## 2. Exploratory Data Visualization

### Stations at the end of 2017

Here is an [<span style="color:blue">interactive map</span>](https://dingma129.github.io/assets/active_image/divvy/station_distribution.html) for station distribution. We can see that most of the stations are located in the downtown area.

### By Year

Annual total trip counts were growing from 2014 to 2017. However, the average trip duration did not change at all.

### By Month 

During June, July, August and September, there were more trips. The average trip duration was also relatively longer during those four months. 

<img src="https://dingma129.github.io/assets/figures/divvy/tripcountvsmonth.png" width="800">

### By Day of Week

There were more rides during weekdays comparing to weekends. But the average trip duration was longer during weekend.

### By Hour

If we take a closer look, there are particular patterns within a day.

- During weekday, there were two peaks of trip counts. One happened at 7:00-8:59, and the other happened at 16:00-18:59.
- During weekend, there was plenty of rides during 8:00-20:59 with no sharp peak.

## 3. Goal of This Project

From the last figure above, we can see that in the weekday, there are much more trip happened during 7:00-8:59 and 16:00-18:59 comparing to other time. So a natural question is: <u>Does every station behave differently</u>?

### Goal:
1. group stations according to their behaviors during weekday, and analyze the reasons causing those different behaviours
2. for each station, create a time-series model to predict the future station usage based on historical data
3. given a GPS location, suggest a user to a nearby station with highest probability that may have an available bike to borrow or may have an available dock to return a borrowed bike

------

## 4. Data Analyses

### 4.1 group stations by their weekday behaviors

For simplicity, we only consider the data after 2016. (since after 2016, the stations do not change a lot)

1. take hourly average over `percent full` column for each station, and create a pivot table like the following.

   <img src="https://dingma129.github.io/assets/figures/divvy/dataset_1.png" width="500">

2. keep the records on business day only

3. take the average on each of the 24-hour over all business days, and get a data frame with rows being all station ids and columns being 24 hours

   <img src="https://dingma129.github.io/assets/figures/divvy/dataset_pivot.png" width="500">

4. run k mean models and gaussian mixture models with 2-9 clusters over this data set, and select the best model using silhouette score

   <img src="https://dingma129.github.io/assets/figures/divvy/model_selection.png" width="500">

   so the best model is k means with 3 clusters

5. if we plot the average `percent full` for each stations with different colors corresponding to their group assigned by k means, and also the group mean, we can clearly see the difference between those 3 groups

   <img src="https://dingma129.github.io/assets/figures/divvy/3_groups.png" width="800">

6. <span style="color:red">a brief conclusion:</span>

   From the above graph, we can see that four groups behave differently:

   * **Group 0**: **high** full percentage during moring and night, **normal** full percentage during daytime

   * **Group 1**: has a **normal** 24 hour full percentage, **stable** during whole day

   * **Group 2**: **low** full percentage during moring and night, **high** full percentage during daytim7

7. in order to see the reason that causing such different behaviors, we plot all the stations with their labels on a map (click [here](https://dingma129.github.io/assets/active_image/divvy/3_groups_large.html) for a large version)

8. <span style="color:red">Further explanations</span>
   The graph above explains the `percent full` behaviours of each group

   * **Group 0**: **high** full percentage during moring and night, **normal** full percentage during daytime

     **Reason:** They mainly locate at living areas. In the morning, there are lots of bicycles. Then people ride them to work, which results in a dramatic decrease of Full Percentage around 6:00-8:00. During daytime, there are few number of bicycles until people ride bicycles from work to home around 16:00-18:00.

   * **Group 1**: has a **normal** 24 hour full percentage, **stable** during whole day

     **Reason:** Not many people use those stations, so the full percentage rarely changes. 

   * **Group 2**: **low** full percentage during moring and night, **high** full percentage during daytime

     **Reason:** They mainly locate at working areas (downtown Chicago). In the morning, there are few bicycles. Then people ride bicycles from home to work, which results in a dramatic increase of Full Percentage around 6:00-8:00. During daytime, there are lots of bicycles until people ride bicycles back to home around 16:00-18:00.

   


9. **Remark: Similar analysis can be done for weekend information, and we will skip it here**



### 4.2 predict the future station usage using time-series model

We will use [Holt-Winters model(triple exponential smoothing model)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_smoothing) to make the prediction.

```
Why do we choose such a model?
The reason why we use triple exponential smoothing instead of single or double is that the station usage has an obvious seasonal change and also a slightly increasing trend. 
```

This model is not implemented in Python, we write our own model class. There are 3 main parameters for this model.

* $0<\alpha<1$: data smoothing factor
* $0<\beta<1$: trend smoothing factor
* $0<\gamma<1$: seasonal change smoothing factor

we first build a separate model for every single station, using random cross-validation to choose the values of $\alpha,\beta,\gamma$. The model will use the `percent full` data in the past 28 days to make predictions in the next 7 days.

Here is one example for station #37, click [here](https://dingma129.github.io/assets/figures/divvy/station_37.png) for a large image.

<img src="https://dingma129.github.io/assets/figures/divvy/station_37.png" width="800">

The above figure shows the prediction of `percent full` of station #37 in the next 7 days, along with a 90% confidence interval.



### 4.3 suggesting stations to borrow or return a bicycle

the last part of this project is to create a user interface that allows user to provide

* a GPS location
* a future time spot
* specify whether he/she wants to borrow or return a bicycle

it will output a map of nearest stations with highest probability where the user can borrow or return a bicycle

for example, with

```python
test_lat = 41.882 
test_lon = -87.63
future_time = '2018-09-21 14:00:00'
finding_bikes = True
```

the model will output the following text and figure

```
At 2018-09-21 14:00:00 

station 49 is predicted to be 78.39% full
station 81 is predicted to be 59.13% full
station 37 is predicted to be 64.15% full
```
