# 0. Introduction

[<u>`TensorFlow.js`</u>](https://www.tensorflow.org/js) is a `JavaScript` Library for training and deploying machine learning models in the browser and in Node.js. Some really cool demos made using `TensorFlow.js` can be found [<u>here</u>](https://www.tensorflow.org/js/demos). In this blog, I will train a linear regression model using `TensorFlow.js` in the browser. All the visiualizations are made using [<u>`tfjs-vis`</u>](https://js.tensorflow.org/api_vis/1.4.0/), which provides some UI helpers to make it easier to render visualizations.

# 1. Final Web Page
The final web page looks like the following. Click [<u>here</u>](/assets/active_image/tensorflowjs/tf01_linear_regression.html) for a full-screen version.

# 2. Source Code
The `JavaScript` source code can be found [<u>here</u>](https://dingma129.github.io/assets/active_image/tensorflowjs/src/tf01.js). Since each function is pretty short, I will only explain the purpose of each of them in below.

* `readFile`: will be triggered whenever a file is uploaded
    1. load the data from `<input>`
    2. parse `.csv` data into `.json` using [<u>Papa Parse</u>](https://www.papaparse.com/)
    3. remove missing data, and save the cleaned data in the global variable `df`

* `dataPreview`: use `tfvis.render.table` to preview the first 10 rows of the data
* `updateStatus`: will print various status on the web page
* `scatterPlot`: use `tfvis.render.scatterplot` to render a scatter plot
* `createModel`: use `tf.sequential` and `tf.layers.dense` to create a linear regression model (a 1-layer neural network with no activation function)
* `modelSummary`: use `tfvis.show.modelSummary` to generate a summary of the model
* `convertToTensor`: 
    1. convert the `.json` data into `tf.tensor`
    2. both inputs and outputs are normalized in this function
* `compileAndFit`:
    1. compile the model using `tf.train.adam` optimizer and `tf.losses.meanSquaredError` loss
    2. set batch size to be `32` and number of epochs to be `50`
    3. fit the model and keep track of the loss at the end of each epoch using `tfvis.show.fitCallbacks`
* `trainModel`: a wrapper of `convertToTensor` and `compileAndFit`
* `makePrediction`:
    1. make prediction for 100 uniformly-distributed between the max and the min of the training data
    2. use `tfvis.render.scatterplot` to plot both training data and prediction
* `predictionPlot`: a wrapper of `makePrediction`
