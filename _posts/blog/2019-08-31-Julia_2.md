<span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:32px">0. Introduction</span>

In this blog, I will introduce how to do a basic classification task on the famous Iris dataset using [`ScikitLearn.jl`](https://scikitlearnjl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), which is a `Julia` wrapper of the popular `Python` library [`scikit-learn`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/).

Run the following line to install this package in `Julia`.
```julia
import Pkg  # need this if using IJulia
Pkg.add("ScikitLearn")
```
We will use the following packages during this blog.
```julia
using DataFrames,Statistics,ScikitLearn
import CSV
```

<span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:32px">1. Load data</span>

First, we need to load the Iris dataset as Arrays.

```julia
# use CSV.read to load a csv file as a Julia DataFrame
iris = CSV.read(joinpath(dirname(pathof(DataFrames)), "../docs/src/assets/iris.csv"));
# transform DataFrame into two Arrays X and y
X = Matrix(iris[:,[:SepalLength, :SepalWidth, :PetalLength, :PetalWidth]])  # shape = (150,4)
y = Array(iris[:,:Species]);  # shape = (150,)
```

<span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:32px">2. Train/test split</span>

We will leave 20% of the data as test data, and train our model on the other 80% data.
```julia
@sk_import model_selection: train_test_split
XTrain,XTest,yTrain,yTest = train_test_split(X,y,test_size=0.2, random_state=42);
println(size(XTrain))
# (120,4)
```

<span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:32px">3. Encoding labels</span>

The label set y contains 3 different strings: "Iris-versicolor", "Iris-virginica", and "Iris-setosa". So we need to encode them to numbers. In `Julia`, functions that modify their inputs have names that end in `!`. The functions `fit` and `fit!` behave differently as follows:
1. `fit(model, X, y)` returns the trained-model but does not modify the input model into the trained-version 
2. `fit!(model, X, y)` returns the trained-model and modify the input model into the trained-version 
```julia
@sk_import preprocessing: LabelEncoder 
labelencoder = LabelEncoder() 
# using fit_transform!, labelencoder will become the fitted version
yTrain = fit_transform!(labelencoder, yTrain)
yTest = transform(labelencoder, yTest); 
```

<span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:32px">4. Train a logistic regression model</span>

Using `multi_class="multinomial"`, the model will be trained using the cross-entropy loss.
```julia
@sk_import linear_model: LogisticRegression
# instantiate a Logistic Regression model
model = LogisticRegression(multi_class="multinomial",solver="lbfgs")
# training using fit! => model will be updated
fit!(model, XTrain, yTrain)
```

---
<span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:32px">5. Evaluate the model</span>

For this simple dataset, a logistic regression behaves quite well.
```julia
# .== returns a boolean vector, vectorized version of ==
accuracyTrain = sum(predict(model, XTrain) .== yTrain) / length(yTrain)
accuracyTest = sum(predict(model, XTest) .== yTest) / length(yTest)
println("accuracy(Train):\t$accuracyTrain")
println("accuracy(Test):\t\t$accuracyTest")
# accuracy(Train):	0.975
# accuracy(Test):		1.0
```
