# Chicago Divvy Bicycle Project

[Divvy](https://www.divvybikes.com/) is a bicycle sharing system in the City of Chicago and two adjacent suburbs operated by Motivate for the Chicago Department of Transportation. It operates 5800 bicycles at 580 stations in an area bounded by 87th Street on the south, Central Street in Evanston on the north, Rainbow Beach Park near South Shore Drive on the east, and Harlem Avenue in Oak Park on the west.

In this blog, I proformed a series of data processing, visualization, and analysis. All the source code can be found in my Github page.

# Data
## Bicycle Data
You can download the Divvy Bicycle data from 2013 to 2017 [here](https://www.divvybikes.com/system-data).
In this data, each trip is anonymized and includes:
  *Trip start day and time
  *Trip end day and time
  *Trip start station
  *Trip end station
  *Rider type (Member, Single Ride, and Explore Pass)
  *If a Member trip, it will also include Memberâ€™s gender and year of birth

## Weather Data
In this project, I write a wrapper to download the historical weathers of Chicago between 2013-2017 from [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration](https://www.noaa.gov).
