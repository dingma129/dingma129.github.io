# 0. Introduction

In this blog, I will discuss the Kaggle competition: [New York City Taxi Fare Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/c/new-york-city-taxi-fare-prediction). 

# 1. Data

## 1.1 Load and preview data
The training data contains about 55M rows, and the data is well-shuffled. In this blog, I will only use the the first 50K rows only.

Let's first look at the dataset.

```python
df = pd.read_csv("data/train.csv",nrows=50000,index_col=0,parse_dates=["pickup_datetime"])
df.reset_index(drop=True, inplace=True)
df.head()
```
<center><img src="/assets/figures/kaggle/2_data.png" width="1000" ></center>
It contains pickup time, pickup/dropoff GPS, number of passengers and fare amount.

## 1.2 Clean data

There are some abnormal rows (for example, 0 passanger counts , 0 fare amount or meanless longitude/latitude). I will first clean the data by removing abnormal rows. Also I will extract `year`, `month`, `day of week` and `hour` information from the `pickup_datetime` column

```python
# extract some time information
df["year"] = df["pickup_datetime"].apply(lambda x: x.year)
df["month"] = df["pickup_datetime"].apply(lambda x: x.month)
df["dayofweek"] = df["pickup_datetime"].apply(lambda x: pd.datetime.isoweekday(x))
df["hour"] = df["pickup_datetime"].apply(lambda x: x.hour)
# keep only 2009-2014
df = df[df["year"] < 2015]
# remove abnormal rows
df = df[df["passenger_count"] > 0]
df = df[df["fare_amount"] > 0]
df = df[(-74.51 < df["pickup_longitude"]) & (df["pickup_longitude"] < -73.29) & (40.39 < df["pickup_latitude"]) &(df["pickup_latitude"] < 41.21)]
df = df[(-74.51 < df["dropoff_longitude"]) & (df["dropoff_longitude"] < -73.29) & (40.39 < df["dropoff_latitude"]) &(df["dropoff_latitude"] < 41.21)]
df.head()
```

## 1.3 Simple feature engineering

I will first create two features corresponding to whether a date is a businessday / holiday.

```python
# holiday list
from pandas.tseries.holiday import USFederalHolidayCalendar as calendar
cal = calendar()
holidays = cal.holidays(start='1/1/2009', end='1/1/2015')
# set of all business days
businessDays = set(pd.datetime.date(d) for d in pd.bdate_range(start='1/1/2009', end='1/1/2015'))
# create is_businessday variable
df["is_businessday"] = df["pickup_datetime"].apply(lambda x: 1 if pd.datetime.date(x) in businessDays else 0)
# create is_holiday variable
df["is_holiday"] = df["pickup_datetime"].apply(lambda x: 1 if pd.datetime.date(x) in holidays else 0)
```

# 2. Visualization

## 2.1 counts and average fares over time

Let's first look at how does the data distribute over year, month, day of week and hour.
<center><img src="/assets/figures/kaggle/2_count.png" width="1000" ></center>
From the above figure, we can clearly see that there are fewer rides during <u><b>1:00 - 6:59</b></u>.

On the other hand, the average fare is much higher during <u><b>4:00 - 5:59</b></u>
<center><img src="/assets/figures/kaggle/2_avg.png" width="1000" ></center>
Using Gaussian kernel density estimation, we can also see the obvious difference during <u><b>4:00 - 5:59</b></u> and other time.

## 2.2 what about location?

Are there any places which are very different from others?

To answer this question, let's first plot the data on a map. We first remove some abnormal data, either the pickup and dropoff locations are too close (less than around 11 meters) or too far (more than around 111 kilometers).

```python
# remove abnormal data
dfplot = df[(np.abs(df["pickup_latitude"]-df["dropoff_latitude"]) + np.abs(df["pickup_longitude"]-df["dropoff_longitude"])>0.0001) 
            & (np.abs(df["pickup_latitude"]-df["dropoff_latitude"]) + np.abs(df["pickup_longitude"]-df["dropoff_longitude"])<1)]
# round GPS to 2 decimals   
dfGPS = dfplot
dfGPS["from_lon"] = np.round(dfGPS["pickup_longitude"],2)
dfGPS["from_lat"] = np.round(dfGPS["pickup_latitude"],2)
dfGPS["to_lon"] = np.round(dfGPS["dropoff_longitude"],2)
dfGPS["to_lat"] = np.round(dfGPS["dropoff_latitude"],2)
```
Using heatmap, we can see that most trips starts and ends in Manhattan, JFK airport or LGA airport.
<center><img src="/assets/figures/kaggle/2_heatmap_count.png" width="1000" ></center>
We can also visualize the average fare by pickup and dropoff locations. We can see that if the pickup/dropoff location is in Manhattan, the average fare would be lower. While if the pickup location is in JFK airport or the dropoff location is not in Manhattan, the average fare would be much higher. 
<center><img src="/assets/figures/kaggle/2_heatmap_fare.png" width="1000" ></center>
By hour, the average fare is always high if the pickup or dropoff location is JFK. We can also seen that the pickup locations are mainly in Manhattan, while the dropoff locations are widely spreaded.

    </div>
  </div>
</center>

## 2.3 more about location

Using `Folium`, we can create the following nice-looking interactive maps.

### 2.3.1 most popular locations
The most popular pickup locations are JFK, LGA, Penn Station, Grand Central Station, Medison Square Garden, Chelsea Market, Columbus Circle. 
<center><iframe src="/assets/active_image/kaggle/2_heatmap_count.html" width="1000" height="600"></iframe></center>
### 2.3.2 pickup locations with highest avg fare
The pickup locations with highest avg fare are JFK and LGA. 
<center><iframe src="/assets/active_image/kaggle/2_heatmap_from.html" width="1000" height="600"></iframe></center>
### 2.3.3 dropoff locations with highest avg fare
The dropoff locations with highest avg fare are JFK, LGA and EWR. Notice that people did take taxi to EWR, altough it's very example to do so.
<center><iframe src="/assets/active_image/kaggle/2_heatmap_to.html" width="1000" height="600"></iframe></center>
### 2.3.4 where did most expensive rides start and end?
In the following figure, red/cyan points represent pickup/dropoff locations. Again, most of the expensive rides are from/to airports.
<center><iframe src="/assets/active_image/kaggle/2_heatmap_expensive.html" width="1000" height="600"></iframe></center>
## 2.4 Are airports really different?
If we look at the distributions of average fares from/to various airport, we can see that they are all pretty different from each other.
<center><img src="/assets/figures/kaggle/2_kde_airport_fare.png" width="1000" ></center>
If we look at the distributions of average distances (here we use degrees in longitude and latitude to approximate the distance) from/to various airport, we can see that they are also very different.
<center><img src="/assets/figures/kaggle/2_kde_airport_distance.png" width="1000" ></center>
Although the EWR is closer to Manhattan than LGA, extra toll costs make the ride fare higher.

# 3. Model and Evaluation


## 3.1 Feature engineering

We can see from above that rides from/to airports have much higher average ride fares. We can create the following features corresponding to whether it's a ride from/to airport or not.

```python
def is_JFK(row):
    return 1 if -73.82 < row[0] < -73.76 and 40.62 < row[1] < 40.69 else 0
def is_LGA(row):
    return 1 if -73.91 < row[0] < -73.84 and 40.75 < row[1] < 40.79 else 0
def is_EWR(row):
    return 1 if -74.20 < row[0] < -74.16 and 40.67 < row[1] < 40.72 else 0

dfplot["from_JFK"] = dfplot[["pickup_longitude","pickup_latitude"]].apply(is_JFK,axis=1)
dfplot["to_JFK"] = dfplot[["dropoff_longitude","dropoff_latitude"]].apply(is_JFK,axis=1)
dfplot["from_LGA"] = dfplot[["pickup_longitude","pickup_latitude"]].apply(is_LGA,axis=1)
dfplot["to_LGA"] = dfplot[["dropoff_longitude","dropoff_latitude"]].apply(is_LGA,axis=1)
dfplot["from_EWR"] = dfplot[["pickup_longitude","pickup_latitude"]].apply(is_EWR,axis=1)
dfplot["to_EWR"] = dfplot[["dropoff_longitude","dropoff_latitude"]].apply(is_EWR,axis=1)
```

## 3.2 Linear models using GPS features only

We can use the original GPS features only to train a linear regression model.
```python
X0 = dfplot[["pickup_latitude","dropoff_latitude","pickup_longitude","dropoff_longitude"]]
y0 = dfplot["fare_amount"]
# train/test split
X0_train, X0_test, y0_train, y0_test = train_test_split(X0, y0, test_size=0.1, random_state=42)
# normalization
scl = StandardScaler()
X0_train = scl.fit_transform(X0_train)
X0_test = scl.transform(X0_test)
# linear regression model
lr = LinearRegression()
lr.fit(X0_train,y0_train)
print("RMSE(train):\t{}".format(np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y0_train,lr.predict(X0_train)))))
print("RMSE(test):\t{}".format(np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y0_test,lr.predict(X0_test)))))
print("MAE(train):\t{}".format(mean_absolute_error(y0_train,lr.predict(X0_train))))
print("MAE(test):\t{}".format(mean_absolute_error(y0_test,lr.predict(X0_test))))
```
```
RMSE(train):	7.793159241052969
RMSE(test):	7.692332651364553
MAE(train):	4.93801790902256
MAE(test):	4.862299777725056
```

## 3.3 Linear model using all features introduced above

We can also use all the features introduced above to train a linear regression model. Here we introduced two more features, changes in degrees of longitude/latitude.

```python
# use all features
X1 = dfplot[["year","month","dayofweek","hour","is_businessday","is_holiday","passenger_count","from_JFK","to_JFK","from_LGA","to_LGA","from_EWR","to_EWR","pickup_latitude","dropoff_latitude","pickup_longitude","dropoff_longitude"]]
# one-hot encoder
X1 = pd.get_dummies(X1,columns=["year","month","dayofweek","hour","passenger_count"],drop_first=True)
X1["lat"] = np.abs(X1["pickup_latitude"] - X1["dropoff_latitude"])
X1["lon"] = np.abs(X1["pickup_longitude"] - X1["dropoff_longitude"])
y1 = dfplot["fare_amount"]
# train/test split
X1_train, X1_test, y1_train, y1_test = train_test_split(X1, y1, test_size=0.1, random_state=42)
# normalization
scl = StandardScaler()
X1_train = scl.fit_transform(X1_train)
X1_test = scl.transform(X1_test)
# linear regression model
lr = LinearRegression()
lr.fit(X1_train,y1_train)
print("RMSE(train):\t{}".format(np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y1_train,lr.predict(X1_train)))))
print("RMSE(test):\t{}".format(np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y1_test,lr.predict(X1_test)))))
print("MAE(train):\t{}".format(mean_absolute_error(y1_train,lr.predict(X1_train))))
print("MAE(test):\t{}".format(mean_absolute_error(y1_test,lr.predict(X1_test))))
```
```
RMSE(train):	4.07524647862884
RMSE(test):	4.33027086131377
MAE(train):	2.154219956275824
MAE(test):	2.1359468518078546
```

## 3.4 XGBoost Regressor model

As usual, XGBoost regressor would always be a better choice for such a problem.

```python
from xgboost import XGBRegressor
xgb = XGBRegressor(max_depth=5,learning_rate=0.2,n_estimators=100,n_jobs=-1,
                   subsample=0.8,colsample_bytree=0.5,gamma=10)
xgb.fit(X1_train,y1_train)
print("RMSE(train):\t{}".format(np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y1_train,xgb.predict(X1_train)))))
print("RMSE(test):\t{}".format(np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y1_test,xgb.predict(X1_test)))))
print("MAE(train):\t{}".format(mean_absolute_error(y1_train,xgb.predict(X1_train))))
print("MAE(test):\t{}".format(mean_absolute_error(y1_test,xgb.predict(X1_test))))
```
```
RMSE(train):	2.6787563569921464
RMSE(test):	3.4669830903827292
MAE(train):	1.5824936820411837
MAE(test):	1.6976151789587666
```
From the following feature importance plot, the most important features are still GPS features. Among them, change in degrees of latitude ranks the 1st and change in degrees of longitude ranks the 3rd.

# 4. Conclusion
From the New York taxt dataset, we found the following interesting things:
1. There are fewer rides during 1:00 - 6:59.
2. The average ride fare are much higher during 4:00 - 5:59. (significantly higher by T-test)
3. Most of the rides starts or ends in Manhattan.
4. Rides starts or ends at airports have higher average fare, and most expensive rides are more likely to start or end at airports.
5. The most popular pickup locations are JFK, LGA, Penn Station, Grand Central Station, Medison Square Garden, Chelsea Market, Columbus Circle.
6. The most popular dropoff locations are JFK, LGA, Penn Station, Grand Central Station, Medison Square Garden.
7. Extra toll costs should also be taken into consideration.
8. As usual, XGBoost regressor performs better than simple linear regression model.
9. The most important features in the XGBoost regressor are all GPS features. Among them, change in degrees of latitude ranks the 1st and change in degrees of longitude ranks the 3rd.
